Currently the shell script is working well
the code and the inputs are getting written in the designated files

the code execution from the browser is not working well, I might need to move all program files to the root directory


<!-- Currently the codes are being executed, except for the TLE(time limit exceeded) situations -->

Time limit Exceed situation & compile time errors are handled properly
(But for python the current directory path is visible fix that)


Feature updates required:
1. Add login & signup feature
2. Use database for storing code, input & output
3. give users options to save their code in the database, so that they can retrieve the code later
4. instead of writing the input in input.txt directly pipe the input to the program, ref: check chat GPT
